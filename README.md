# TextDrawSetPreviewModelForPlayer

Useful for changing the preview model of a textdraw (global) for just one player. Useful when a playertext overlaps a textdraw or when it is not possible to create a textdraw for each player.

To be noted that you need [Pawn.RakNet](https://github.com/katursis/Pawn.RakNet) to make this function works
